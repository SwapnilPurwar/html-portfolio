<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm Swapnil Purwar, a computer science student at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. I am deeply fascinated by 
  evolving technology and the endless possibilities that technology offers. This led me to pursue my BE degree
  in computer science. Through my journey, I have built a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, 
  and software development.</p>
<p>One aspect that distinguishes me is my curiosity and eagerness to learn new technology and stay up-to-date. 
  And apply them to solving real-life problems.</p>
<p>Beyond code, my hobby is stargazing and learning new things about space. By seeing a magical night sky 
  full of stars, it gives me a constant reminder of how vast the universe is and how much there is to explore 
  and discover. And some time my life look like <i>while(life){eat; code; sleep;}</i>.</p>
<p>If you want to collaborate, want a fresh perspective on your project, or just want to spend time talking 
  about space or gazing at stars, feel free to contact me. I hope we will meet soon.</p>
<p>(Oh! I forgot to mention I am going to study blockchain and machine learning next.)</p>
